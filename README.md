VAGABOND
“The Travel App of the people, by the people, for the
people”.


PROBLEM STATEMENT
1. The average tourist is often misled to believe that he is being given the
best option by the agency .
2. Even though we have democracy in the real world the virtual world is
dominated solely by a few big players who capitalize on to make “ users
the product ” and all their algorithms are optimised for “ user
attention ” rather than “user experience”.
3. Hence to bring back the core ideal of a product to be built around the
consumer rather than the revenue model we have come up with a
decentralised , peer to peer blockchain application which also eases the
transit by using ML models.


Android App
DESCRIPTION AND PRESENTATION


TOOLS AND SOFTWARES USED
1. ANDROID STUDIO
2. HYPERLEDGER BLOCKCHAIN
3. AZURE MACHINE LEARNING STUDIO



HYPERLEDGER PLATFORM
1. All the transaction in the network is completely peer to peer via the blockchain.
2. Due to this the data privacy and data integrity is preserved and hence the end
users data is protected and stored safely.
3. Unlike the private blockchains which are immutable the hyper ledger
framework offers the flexibility of the centralised databases and it also provides
the security of decentralised data bases .
4. By using decentralization the revenue flow sticks between the entities rather
than being dependant on the third party.
5. It used PBFT algorithm.





ML Algorithm
1. We are trying to optimize the travel schedule for the customer by using ML.
1. The algorithm is fed a large data set which learns to predict the delay time of
flights and hence alerting the passenger as well as the airlines / railways.
1. It uses LINEAR REGRESSION model which is trained to statistically predict
the probable delay time of a flight given its origin and destination.





CONCLUSION
VAGABOND is a marriage between ML , BLOCKCHAIN , AND MOBILE
PLATFORM.
VAGABOND provides for a smart , decentralised solution to every traveller .
